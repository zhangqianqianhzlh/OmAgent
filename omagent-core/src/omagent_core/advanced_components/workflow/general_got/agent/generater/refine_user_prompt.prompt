Please analyze and refine the following result:



Current Result:
{{current_task_input}}

Your task is to:
1. Analyze if the current result is correct
2. Identify any errors or missing elements
3. Provide a refined version that fixes any issues

Return a JSON object in the same format as the current result, but with corrections if needed:
{
    "task": "task_type",
    "result": "corrected description of results"
}

Note: Only make changes if there are actual errors to fix. If the current result is correct, return it unchanged.
